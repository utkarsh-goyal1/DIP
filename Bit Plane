img=imread('cameraman.tif')

subplot(3,3,1);
imshow(img)
for i=1:8
    bitImage=bitget(img,i)
    subplot(3,3,i+1)
    imshow(logical(bitImage))
    title(['Bit Plane',num2str(i)])
end


When logical(bitImage) is applied, it converts the matrix obtained from bitget() into a logical matrix where:
0s are represented as logical false (black in the displayed image).
1s are represented as logical true (white in the displayed image).
